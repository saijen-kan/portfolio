        <p>Hello, my name is Villian and I'd like to introduce myself in a few words. Raised in Sofia as a child neither being Naughty or Nice every time me and my Friends were faulty...., but "What else" some people said! However, the Story begins somewhere in 1987.</p>

        <h3>1987</h3>
        <h6>The begining</h6>
        <p>Sitting in the chair before my first Computer was a great Experience back in the days, especially with games like "Karateka" (Nobody heard about, nowadays I think...it was so impressive:-))</p>
      </div>

      <div class="job job-2">
        <h3>How about starting with nothing...</h3>
        <h6>......</h6>
        <p>Finishing High School was a long and winding road journey experience that I'll never forget. In 96'  I enter the Bulgarian ARMY for a Year and a half. After that, all started to make sense in the work process, in fact, my first job was a great experience in IT sector working with great Colleges.</p>

        <h6>Here we are</h6>
        <p>Making decisions is one of the most difficult things in life. Perhaps most of the people are saying now..... "Why"-you may ask. And here is the thing, Me practicing WEB development and bringing Sites to Life is not exactly one of the easiest things in the World. Now, when all it's begun, it is just like Poetry.</p>
